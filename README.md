This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


## GitHub
You can create a project, and add a repository to it.

To push to GitHub, simply create a repository on GitHub, make it empty as much as possible.

Then use the remote url to the https url for the repo. Note: For simplicity, DO NOT use the SSH URL. 

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/reaphsoft-org/reaphsoft-web.git
git push -u origin main
```

To change the URL when it has already been set, use
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/reaphsoft-org/reaphsoft-web.git
git remote -v 
```
